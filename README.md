# FingerCounter
In this project I have made a program that uses real time camera to count the fingers you are holding up.

This Project Works on both Hands Back and Front.

I Used OpenCV to use the Camera and MediaPipe for this project.

I also made a home-made Modeule Named HandTrackingModule.py to get the positions of Landmarks in a Numpy Array.

The Only Limitation in my Project is that you have to keep your hands strainght for the counter to work correctly.

I had a solution for that which when I implemented I was getting rellay low FPS as the system I am working on currently does not have a good CPU or GPU.

Here are some Exaple
